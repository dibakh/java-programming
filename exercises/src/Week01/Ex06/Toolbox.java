//    You need the following classes: Tool, Toolbox, ShopAssistant and ToolShopApplication.
//        Reuse the Tool from exercise 3 (donâ€™t copy it, reuse the existing one from the package where it already is).

//        A Toolbox has a color and a list of Tool.
//          Its constructor only asks for the color.
//          Make sure its tools are initialized with an empty collection.
//          It also has the method add to add a Tool to its list and
//          the method getTools that returns the list.
//          It also has the getColor method.

//        A ShopAssistant has no attributes. It has the findToolbox method that receives a list of String representing the names of the tools the customer asks for and returns a Toolbox. In order to create a Toolbox it creates one tool per tool requested adding them to the Toolbox then it returns it.
//        In the ToolShopApplication class main method, create a list of String with three tool names inside, create a ShopAssistant and use it to find a red Toolbox with those three tools inside.
