//
//    Matilda wants to include automatically a group of friends that cannot show up for the signup, but already confirmed on the phone. But she doesnâ€™t want anybody else to know that she customized the application for them, so she wants to keep this as a secret.
//        Develop the following code reusing the existing one from Exercise 1.
//        Create the gatherer package and move the Gatherer class inside.
//        Define the AutomaticGatherer agent class in the gatherer package that has a getConfirmedHikers method that provides a predefined list of five hikers. This method has a default visibility so that only the Gatherer class can use it.
//        Update the Gatherer class signUp method to always include the confirmed hikers.
